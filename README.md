# â›³ Code Golf: Hole 12 - Total Eclipse of the (ASCII) Art

(This challenge was originally posted as the [Stack Overflow Code Golf challenge: "[Extendify the ASCII Sun](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/49781/extendify-the-ascii-sun?page=1&tab=scoredesc#tab-top)".)

Let's golf the eclipse -- or, rather, the opposite of the eclipse -- using ASCII art! Your task in this challenge is to draw a picture of the sun
scalable to any number of characters on screen. In practice, this looks like the following at `10` units:
```
\        |        /
 \       |       /
  \      |      /
   \     |     /
    \    |    /
     \   |   /
      \  |  /
       \ | /
        \|/
---------O---------
        /|\
       / | \
      /  |  \
     /   |   \
    /    |    \
   /     |     \
  /      |      \
 /       |       \
/        |        \
```

## Notes to players

* This week's tests check three arbitrary art sizes, not just the `3` included in the `pom.xml` file
* The center character in the above art is the letter `O`, not the number zero
* To check results of this challenge's work, the test framework uses `checksums` to verify content; the easiest way to ensure you're "doing the right thing" is to change the `<argument>...</argument>` in the `12/pom.xml` file to reflect the size of sun you're trying to make

### Program termination

For some players, `mvn exec:java -q` might not terminate the program. To force the program to exit, press `CTRL` + `C`. 
`mvn test` will run and terminate successfully if the output is correct.

## Tips

* [General tips for golfing with any language](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/5285/tips-for-golfing-in-all-languages)

## Requirements

* this challenge must be completed using the `Jactl` language
* the program must be written in the `10/src/test/resources/main.jactl` file
* the program's output must evaluate the `10` sentences in the main.input file

## Infrastructure

If you're familiar with running Java programs, you can feel free to `javac` or use your own framework to your heart's content. 
However, this repository leverages the build lifecycle using Apache Maven. Several challenges will require Java, it might be advantageous 
for you to do so.

Given the prevalence of VSCode installs, the league provides the following resources for you should you want to install and use
Maven in VSCode.

### Installing Java resources 

This toolchain uses:

* Java JDK/JRE
* Apache Maven
* Microsoft VSCode

Along with downloading and installing each component piecemeal, VSCode's Marketplace features plugins that accommodate both the Java runtime and Maven integration. After installing VSCode, if not already installed:

* Download the appropriate Java resources from the [VSCode "Java in Visual Studio Code" guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java), namely:
  * The [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [VSCode Extension Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build) which features the Maven build platform
* Install Apache Maven according to relevant OS instructions below

#### Note for Linux distribution users

Your lives are a bit easier. To download and install the necessary Java development kit and runtime, use the following commands (if using a Debian-derived distribution such as Ubuntu):

* `apt-get install default-jdk`
* `apt-get install default-jre`

### Installing Apache Maven

#### Windows

* Download the [latest `zip` archive of Apache Maven](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip)
* Create a folder in your `C:` drive partition at `C:\maven`
* Extract the contents of the `zip` file to the `C:\maven` directory

#### Mac OSX

* Use `brew` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `brew install maven`

#### Debian-based Linux distributions

* Use `apt-get` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `apt-get install maven`

### Running with Maven

The following lifecycle steps are key to running this project with Maven:

|Lifecycle step |Purpose |
|:--------------|:-------|
|`clean`        |Removes all compiled targets |
|`compile`      |Rebuilds compiled targets|
|`test`         |Runs the test that the evaluator runs|
