# â›³ Code Golf: Hole 11 - It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a...ptero-Jactl?

(This challenge was originally posted as the [Stack Overflow Code Golf challenge: "Are Pigs able to fly?"](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35623/are-pigs-able-to-fly).)

This challenge is partly an exploration of programming grammar and an equal dose logic game. this week we use the `Jactl` language 
in an effort to determine whether or not a given combination of statements indicates that a given pterodactyl actually flies. For
example:

> Pterodactyls are old. Everything that is not able to fly is also not old.

Our question: does this pterodactyl fly? Well, it is old, and all things _not old_ (i.e. young) _don't_ fly. So, our answer: `Yes`.

Here're the rules (taken from the above Stack Overflow link):

> ## Input
> The input is a String that can be read from STDIN, taken as a function argument or even be stored in a file. The input can be described using the following grammar:
>
> ```input = statement , {statement};
> statement = (("Pterodactyls are ", attribute) | ("Everything that is ", attribute, "is also ", attribute)), ". ";
> attribute = [not], ("able to fly" | singleAttribute);
> singleAttribute = letter, {letter};
> letter = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g"
>        | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n"
>        | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u"
>        | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
> ```
>
>Example input (see more examples below):
>
> ```Pterodactyls are green. Everything that is green is also intelligent. Everything that is able to fly is also not intelligent. Pterodactyls are sweet.``` 
> ## Output
> The output can be returned by your function, be written to a file or print to STDOUT. There are a few cases to handle:
>
>* The given statements are valid, consistent and have as a logical consequence that [pterodactyls] can fly. In that case, you must output `Yes`.
>* The given statements are valid, consistent and have as a logical consequence that [pterodactyls] can not fly. In that case, you must output `No`.
>* It can not be concluded from the given, valid and consistent statements whether [pterodactyls] can fly or not. In that case, you must output `Maybe`.
> ## Details
> You may assume that the given attributes are independent from each other. So, for example, a pig may be young and old, green, red and blue at the same time without causing any inconsistency. However, a pig may not be 'green' and 'not green' at the same time, that's a contradiction and should be handled as described in (4).
> For every attribute, assume that there is at least one object (not necessarily a pig) in the universe that has the given attribute, and one object that doesn't have it.

## Tips

Tips for golfing are available as general pointers:

* [General tips for golfing with any language](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/5285/tips-for-golfing-in-all-languages)

There exists a `README` and a fairly deep page for the langauge:

* [Jactl Language `README`](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl)
* [Jactl Language site](https://jactl.io/)

## Requirements

* this challenge must be completed using the `Jactl` language
* the program must be written in the `10/src/test/resources/main.jactl` file
* the program's output must evaluate the `10` sentences in the main.input file

## Infrastructure

If you're familiar with running Java programs, you can feel free to `javac` or use your own framework to your heart's content. 
However, this repository leverages the build lifecycle using Apache Maven. Several challenges will require Java, it might be advantageous 
for you to do so.

Given the prevalence of VSCode installs, the league provides the following resources for you should you want to install and use
Maven in VSCode.

### Installing Java resources 

This toolchain uses:

* Java JDK/JRE
* Apache Maven
* Microsoft VSCode

Along with downloading and installing each component piecemeal, VSCode's Marketplace features plugins that accommodate both the Java runtime and Maven integration. After installing VSCode, if not already installed:

* Download the appropriate Java resources from the [VSCode "Java in Visual Studio Code" guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java), namely:
  * The [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [VSCode Extension Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build) which features the Maven build platform
* Install Apache Maven according to relevant OS instructions below

#### Note for Linux distribution users

Your lives are a bit easier. To download and install the necessary Java development kit and runtime, use the following commands (if using a Debian-derived distribution such as Ubuntu):

* `apt-get install default-jdk`
* `apt-get install default-jre`

### Installing Apache Maven

#### Windows

* Download the [latest `zip` archive of Apache Maven](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip)
* Create a folder in your `C:` drive partition at `C:\maven`
* Extract the contents of the `zip` file to the `C:\maven` directory

#### Mac OSX

* Use `brew` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `brew install maven`

#### Debian-based Linux distributions

* Use `apt-get` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `apt-get install maven`

### Running with Maven

The following lifecycle steps are key to running this project with Maven:

|Lifecycle step |Purpose |
|:--------------|:-------|
|`clean`        |Removes all compiled targets |
|`compile`      |Rebuilds compiled targets|
|`test`         |Runs the test that the evaluator runs|
