## The last round

For our last around, the ACGA would like you to engage in a reflective activity. Thinking about the many challenges completed so far (17!), the
[18/reflection.md](docs/reflection.md) file contains several questions to gauge the results of the season. _This is not a golfing challenge as such_
(i.e., you're not trying to answer in as few characters as possible). The goal of this exercise is to understand better the intangibles behind
the practice of code golfing.

## Note to players

To complete this work, respond to the prompts in [18/reflection.md](18/reflection.md). In the tradition of miniature golf (which is the second-best
kind of golf), this challenge is scored using the following rules:

* _not_ completing the challenge results in a score of `843`
* completing the challenge (i.e. no TODOs, and exhaustive answers) will net a score of `0`

tl;dr: do it, and you'll get 843 bytes _for free_; don't do it, and you'll get the full boat's worth.
