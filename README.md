# â›³ Code Golf: Hole 15 - Back to BASIC(s) (Lox Edition)

This one's a blast from our recent past; Your goal is to print the following `10`x`10` grid of stars:
```
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
```
However, unlike last time, we're doing this thing in `Lox`! The margin for par is pretty slim, but you should be able to use
your `Lox` knowledge, accumulated over the course of the semester, to shave at least `33%` (or more!) off of the code. This
challenge is a bit different, as the solution _is not in the repository history_! If you'd like to revisit how this was
implemented in the past, head on over to [Round 6](https://github.com/Allegheny-Code-Colf-Association/season-spring-2024/tree/round-6).

## Tips

Tips for golfing are available for the JASIC language and as general pointers:

* [General tips for golfing with any language](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/5285/tips-for-golfing-in-all-languages)

## Requirements

* this challenge must be completed using the `Lox` interpreter
  * the version of the interpreter contains everything we've done up to (and including) `Classes`
* the program must run and correctly print the `10`x`10` grid of `*` characters
* the program must be written in the `15/src/test/resources/main.lox` file

## Infrastructure

If you're familiar with running Java programs, you can feel free to `javac` or use your own framework to your heart's content. 
However, this repository leverages the build lifecycle using Apache Maven. Several challenges will require Java, it might be advantageous 
for you to do so.

Given the prevalence of VSCode installs, the league provides the following resources for you should you want to install and use
Maven in VSCode.

### Installing Java resources 

This toolchain uses:

* Java JDK/JRE
* Apache Maven
* Microsoft VSCode

Along with downloading and installing each component piecemeal, VSCode's Marketplace features plugins that accommodate both the Java runtime and Maven integration. After installing VSCode, if not already installed:

* Download the appropriate Java resources from the [VSCode "Java in Visual Studio Code" guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java), namely:
  * The [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [VSCode Extension Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build) which features the Maven build platform
* Install Apache Maven according to relevant OS instructions below

#### Note for Linux distribution users

Your lives are a bit easier. To download and install the necessary Java development kit and runtime, use the following commands (if using a Debian-derived distribution such as Ubuntu):

* `apt-get install default-jdk`
* `apt-get install default-jre`

### Installing Apache Maven

#### Windows

* Download the [latest `zip` archive of Apache Maven](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip)
* Create a folder in your `C:` drive partition at `C:\maven`
* Extract the contents of the `zip` file to the `C:\maven` directory

#### Mac OSX

* Use `brew` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `brew install maven`

#### Debian-based Linux distributions

* Use `apt-get` to install the latest version of Apache Maven: `apt-get install maven`

### Running with Maven

The following lifecycle steps are key to running this project with Maven:

|Lifecycle step |Purpose |
|:--------------|:-------|
|`clean`        |Removes all compiled targets |
|`compile`      |Rebuilds compiled targets|
|`test`         |Runs the test that the evaluator runs|
